# InteliPen
## Project Overview

Welcome to the IntelliPen project! IntelliPen is a concept for a smart pen capable of recognizing characters written by the user through the analysis of accelerometer and gyroscope data. This innovative device performs inference directly on the device itself, which is built using an Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect.


## Introduction

IntelliPen emerged from an exhilarating journey into the integration of machine learning with embedded systems. In just 5 days, we conceived and brought to life a prototype that can recognize handwritten characters without the aid of a camera. Instead, it accurately detects and interprets the user's hand motions.

IntelliPen functions as a standalone device, requiring no internet or computer connection to operate. However, it has the capability to transmit recognized data to a computer or the internet via Wi-Fi if desired.
Features

    **Standalone Operation**: Works independently without the need for an internet connection or computer.
    **Wi-Fi Connectivity**: Optionally transmits data to external devices.
    **Real-time Processing**: Performs character recognition in real-time using onboard machine learning models.
    **High Accuracy**: Achieved an accuracy of 92.8% and an F1-score of 92.7%.
